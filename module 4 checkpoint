Teacher­led. Before starting, make sure every student has imported their Module 0 Java
Project into Eclipse. Check that all programs are closed but students have selected the
default package in the Eclipse Package Explorer.


Instruct students to do the following ­ check student screens to monitor understanding.


Help students who are stuck, but note lack of mastery. 

          1. Create a new Java class called Checkpoint
          
          2. Add a main method to the class
          
          3. Code a pop­up dialog to ask the user for their favorite color, 
          e.g. “red”
          
          4. Code another pop­up dialog to tell the user that the color they typed is also
your favorite color, 
          e.g. “red is also my favorite color”
          
          5. Draw a triangle on the screen using a Robot object (Hint: turn angle = 120).


EXTRA: For students who complete activity quickly, have them try to turn the name of
the color into a matching pen color and have the robot draw the triangle in that color.
This is NOT part of the checkpoint!

1. Fill in the blanks
__________String__________ favoriteHobby = "programming";
___________int_________ numberOfToes = 10;
___________int_________ degreesInARightAngle = 90;
____________int________ myAge = _________11___________;
String __________j__________ = "Java";
double __________a__________ = 3.14159;
2. Initialize these variables...
    String whatIWantToBeWhenIGrowUp="coder";
    int facebookFriends=1000000;
    String myBirthday="december 20, 2007";
    int sidesInATriangle=3;
3. Declare and initialize variables for...
    ­ String birthday="movie";'
    ­ String lastmealyouate="noodles"
    ­ int bed=10;
    ­ int = Robotprogramsyouhavewritten=100;
    
    
    
    
    
    On paper, write code that does the following: 
    
    
1. Get a random whole number that is less than 1,000.
Random randy=i(i<1000)
2. Get another random whole number that is less than 900.
3. Print:
          a) What happens when you add the numbers , e.g. 99 + 64 = 163 
          b) What happens when you subtract the numbers , e.g. 99 ­ 64 = 35
